With its rich flavor and velvety texture, it's guaranteed to impress even the most discerning dinner guests. The secret lies in the slow cooking process, which allows the Arborio rice to release its starches gradually, creating that signature creamy consistency that makes risotto so special.</p><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li><li>6 cups chicken broth, warmed</li><li>1 cup dry white wine (preferably Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc)</li><li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li><li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li><li>3 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li><li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano recommended)</li><li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li><li>2 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped</li><li>1/4 cup heavy cream (optional, for extra richness)</li></ul><h3>Instructions</h3><ol><li>In a large pot, heat the olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter over medium heat until the butter melts and starts to bubble.</li><li>Add the onion and saut√© until translucent and soft, about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent browning.</li><li>Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant, being careful not to let it brown.</li><li>Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat with the oil and butter. Toast the rice for about 2 minutes until the edges become slightly translucent.</li><li>Pour in the white wine and stir constantly until it's almost completely absorbed, allowing the rice to absorb the wine's flavor.</li><li>Begin adding the warm broth, one ladle at a time (about 1/2 cup), stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is almost completely absorbed before adding more. The constant stirring helps release the rice's starches.</li><li>Continue this process until the rice is creamy and al dente, about 18-20 minutes. The rice should be tender but still have a slight bite in the center.</li><li>Remove from heat and stir in the remaining butter, Parmesan cheese, and heavy cream if using.</li><li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remember that Parmesan is salty, so taste before adding salt.</li><li>Garnish with fresh parsley and additional Parmesan if desired.</li></ol><p>Serve immediately while hot and creamy. For the perfect texture, the risotto should slowly spread on the plate but not be too runny. This risotto pairs beautifully with grilled chicken, seared scallops, or a simple green salad. For best results, use high-quality Parmesan and don't skip the wine - it adds depth and complexity to the final dish.</p><h3>Tips for Perfect Risotto</h3><ul><li>Keep the broth warm throughout cooking - cold broth will interrupt the cooking process</li><li>Don't rush the process - risotto takes patience</li><li>Stir frequently but not constantly to achieve the right texture</li><li>Use room temperature butter and cheese for the best incorporation</li></ul>","risotto,italian,dinner,comfort food","10 min","25 min","35 min","4","Medium"
