    content: `
      <p>This beautiful French Apple Tart combines a buttery, crisp pastry with sweet, caramelized apples for an elegant dessert that's surprisingly simple to make.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>For the pastry:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>

      </ul>
      <h4>For the filling:</h4>

        <li>4-5 large apples (preferably Honeycrisp or Granny Smith)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>

        <li>In a food processor, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to mix.</li>
        <li>Add the cold, cubed butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>

      </ol>
      <h4>For the filling:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel, core, and slice the apples very thinly (about 1/8 inch thick).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss the apple slices with lemon juice, 1/4 cup of sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Arrange the apple slices in concentric circles on the tart crust, overlapping slightly.</li>
        <li>Brush the apples with melted butter and sprinkle with the remaining sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-45 minutes, until the crust is golden and the apples are tender and caramelized.</li>
        <li>Heat the apricot jam in a small saucepan or microwave until liquid, then brush over the warm tart for a glossy finish.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool before removing from the tart pan and serving.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This tart is delicious on its own or served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of crème fraîche.</p>

    excerpt: "Learn to make incredible sourdough bread with a crispy crust and tender, flavorful interior.",
    content: `
      <p>Making your own sourdough bread is a rewarding process that results in a flavorful loaf with a crispy crust and chewy interior. While it takes time, most of it is hands-off fermentation that develops that distinctive sourdough taste.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>100g active sourdough starter (100% hydration)</li>
        <li>350g bread flour</li>
        <li>50g whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>275g water, room temperature</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>Rice flour for dusting (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <h4>Day 1 - Morning: Prepare the Levain</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix 25g of your sourdough starter with 50g bread flour and 50g water. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 4-6 hours until bubbly and active.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Day 1 - Afternoon: Make the Dough</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the active levain with 350g bread flour, 50g whole wheat flour, and 275g water. Mix until no dry flour remains. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes (this is the autolyse period).</li>
        <li>Add the salt and mix it into the dough by pinching and folding.</li>
        <li>Perform a series of stretch and folds: Wet your hands, grab one side of the dough, stretch it up and fold it over the top. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Do this for all four sides of the dough. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat the stretch and fold process every 30 minutes for a total of 4-6 sets, or until the dough feels stronger and more elastic.</li>
        <li>After the final fold, cover the dough and allow it to ferment at room temperature for 2-3 hours, or until it has increased in volume by about 50%.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Day 1 - Evening: Shape and Cold Proof</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Gently turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, being careful not to deflate it too much.</li>
        <li>Fold the edges of the dough into the center to create tension on the surface, then flip it over so the seam side is down.</li>
        <li>Using your hands or a bench scraper, gently drag the dough in circles on the counter, creating tension and forming a round boule shape.</li>
        <li>Dust a proofing basket or bowl lined with a clean kitchen towel generously with flour (rice flour works best).</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the basket, seam side up.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate overnight (8-12 hours).</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Day 2: Bake</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C) with a Dutch oven or combo cooker inside for at least 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>When ready to bake, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Turn it out onto a piece of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Score the top of the loaf with a sharp knife or bread lame to allow for expansion during baking.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the dough on the parchment paper into the hot Dutch oven. Cover with the lid.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 450°F (230°C) and bake for 20 minutes with the lid on.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid and continue baking for 20-30 minutes more, until the crust is deeply golden and the internal temperature reaches at least 205°F (96°C).</li>
        <li>Transfer the baked loaf to a wire rack and let it cool completely (at least 2 hours) before slicing.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The wait is worth it! Cutting into warm sourdough bread too soon can result in a gummy texture. For the best flavor and texture, allow the bread to cool fully before enjoying.</p>
